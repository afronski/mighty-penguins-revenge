How to learn new stuff effectively? The best way is to create something and get as much fun as we can from the creation process.

How achieve the highest fun-to-learning ratio? By writting a game :wink:.

## Description

`mighty-penguins-revenge` is a multiplayer action game written fully in JavaScript (with use of *Node.js*, *LevelDB*, *socket.io* on the back-end and with *HTML 5* related technologies on client-side with addition of amazing, small game library called [Jaws](https://https://github.com/ippa/jaws).

As you can see on the screenshot posted above - it is highly inspired by games like *Liero* or *Worms* :wink:.

## Motivation

I've created it for the purpose of the interactive workshop of subject Node.js.
Workshop took place at Future-Processing in January 2014.
