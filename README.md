# Mighty Penguins Revenge!

How to learn new stuff effectively? The best way is to create something and get as much fun as we can from the creation process.

How achieve the highest fun-to-learning ratio? By writting a game :wink:.

## Description

`mighty-penguins-revenge` is a multiplayer action game written fully in JavaScript (with use of *Node.js*, *LevelDB*, *socket.io* on the back-end and with *HTML 5* related technologies on client-side with addition of amazing, small game library called [Jaws](https://https://github.com/ippa/jaws).

As you can see on the screenshot posted above - it is highly inspired by games like *Liero* or *Worms* :wink:.
